## 📃🗯 About the Projects:
#### 1. Dataset:
 __Source__: [The Link Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/die9origephit/children-vs-adults-images)

__Description__: The dataset contains 2 folders: one with the test data and the other one with train data. The test-train-split ratio is 0.15, with the test dataset containing 120 images and the train dataset containing 680. The images have a resolution of 370x320 pixels in RGB color model. Both the folders contain 2 classes: 
* Adults 
* Children

#### 2. Objective:
In this project we try to make computer vision project around classify chidren and adult images from the dataset provided above. Allon the process, also, we did make some augmentation of the data, also try to make some transfer learning for making better and good predection.
